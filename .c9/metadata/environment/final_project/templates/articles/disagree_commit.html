Predictions point that London will have around 10 Million inhabitants by 2030 (1.06% CAGR) which makes London the fastest growing city in Europe. London Infrastructure Plan 2050 estimate that with that current growth and the tube&rsquo;s growing &ldquo;market share&rdquo; could make demand spike an astonishing 60%!</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">According to the article there are currently 4.4 million people using the tube everyday in London but just in a couple of years they will have to accommodate around 7.6 million people!</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">OK now I&rsquo;m sounding like one of those people who loves trains right? Hey I&rsquo;m not judging&hellip;</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">The article caught my eye because London&rsquo;s tube is having the typical problem of companies/startups</span> <span class=\"c1 c12\">&ldquo;growing too fast&rdquo;</span><span class=\"c3 c1\">. Sure, the tube does not have the economics of scale that we see in today&rsquo;s startups, but still the problem is somewhat similar. Companies/Startups reimagine the flow and process of users over their website/platform just as TfL has to figure it out how to get passengers in and out of the tube.</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">But consider this, when a company is struggling with too much growth, or a clear bottleneck on their product, they face problems as low conversion rates, slow site speeds or in extreme cases downtime; In the case of the London tube they can have problems that can range from congestion to stampedes on escalators!</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">While companies face the loss of revenue when not fixing bottlenecks, the London tube faces problems such as public order, welfare and economic impact of the city!</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">I ask you, how could the tube tackle this issue?</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">&ldquo;Just build more stations! Get more trains, faster and bigger&rdquo;- This is happening and constantly! Right when the article was published they were finishing the upgrade of Tottenham Court Road Station which cost &pound;500M. Building more infrastructure and upgrading current facilities is a good way to tackle the issue though it&rsquo;s still not enough&hellip; Just like when startups start</span> <span class=\"c1 c6\"><a class=\"c5\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-Marketing-High-Tech-Mainstream/dp/0060517123&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1589454257758000\">Crossing the Chasm</a></span><span class=\"c3 c1\">&nbsp;you shouldn&rsquo;t just apply the same formula you had until that point and just pour the money in! &ldquo;War-Chests&rdquo; are good (in case of the tube: tax money) but they are not the only or should not be the only factor of success! Sometimes you just have to think differently regarding your product, strive to build growth/capacity from the inside, making your product even greater!</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">The task seems sexy and attractive but sometimes you have to go really dirty to do this! You will have to challenge established conventions that will make your customers, colleagues and even superiors look at you twice since you are directly defying their beliefs. Transports for London did just that.</span></p>","\t<h2 class=\"c8\" id=\"h.cn75rnhzd0dk\"><span class=\"c3 c4\">The Challenge</span></h2>","\t<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">TfL went the distance, trying to challenge one of the biggest conventions in the tube&rsquo;s history: The golden rule of standing on the right when in the escalator. (The left is reserved for people in a hurry.) TfL wanted test an idea by going against this major convention of British society: they wanted people to stand both right and left of the escalator.</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">My first thought was: &ldquo;Why test escalators? Why not make trains go faster? Or take more people?&rdquo;. The problem is that the current bottleneck is not on train speed, frequency or capacity but indeed in getting in and out of the tube station. Contrary to many technology improvements it seems that the evolution of train technology is just making things worse in this particular problem.</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">Without a clear understanding of your business it&rsquo;s easy getting stuck on the thought I initially had. Just like TfL, companies and more importantly startups should get to know deeply the levers of their business on what makes its business grow. More than often you see key leaders in organizations saying that you just need some kind of silver bullet to get to that exponential growth or the usual more of the same: &ldquo;We need MORE Leads!&rdquo;</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c7\"><span style=\"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 500.00px; height: 233.33px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/static/images/image2.gif\" style=\"width: 500.00px; height: 233.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);\" title=\"\"></span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">Strive to understand deeply your customer, your product, your whole</span> <span class=\"c1 c6\"><a class=\"c5\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://firstround.com/review/indispensable-growth-frameworks-from-my-years-at-facebook-twitter-and-wealthfront/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1589454257759000\">growth equation</a></span><span class=\"c3 c1\">&nbsp;so you are able to take more and better informed decisions. You will be able spot quick wins that will feed your growth machine faster! You will be able to identify the &ldquo;escalators&rdquo; of your business, low cost/effort actions that result impact significantly results!</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">TfL clearly identifies that if they get more people in and out of the tube they will be able to fill more trains therefore they can grow organically their station passenger capacity or at least adjust to the organic growth estimated for the foreseeing future. By taking advantage of this aspect of their product they are able to empower a key lever in their business and probably save a significant portion of tax money.</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">Now getting back to the Holborn Project.</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">Holborn is one of the busiest tube&rsquo; stations with an escalator height superior to 20 meters. According to the article a 2002 study of escalator capacity only 40% of users would even contemplate to climb it instead of standing. Seemed like the perfect test subject!</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">In the following illustration you see quite clearly the flow of passengers and the clear bottlenecks represented as blue circles in the Holborn escalators.</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c14\"><span style=\"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 602.00px; height: 221.33px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/static/images/image5.png\" style=\"width: 602.00px; height: 221.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);\" title=\"\"></span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">TfL in order to mitigate the bottlenecks chose the first escalator to run their trial.

This part right here is what amazed me the most on the whole article. What we see here is a well done and implemented testing framework to prove an idea. You have a clear assumption, a clear hypothesis and a clear estimation of success.</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">While this might seem obvious to everybody I dare you to take a look around your business and see how many times you made or you saw decisions being made in the past without first doing a proper test.</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">First think about the multitude of things that were decided because someone thought it was the &ldquo;One True Way&rdquo; without any kind of testing or informed assumptions behind it.</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">Second, think of the number of people who said &ldquo;NO&rdquo; to an idea because in their minds it was not executable.</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">Third, think of the crazy amount of stuff that you have done in the past, but no one measured its success properly.

It&rsquo;s an ongoing war with small victories and defeats that both pave the way to success. To keep consistency in this &ldquo;ongoing war&rdquo;, you need to have a clear and fast process in your company that streamlines all decision making through tests that will create assumptions to build your business upon.</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c0\">&ldquo;You need a process that is going to continually generate new growth ideas, test them efficiently, learn from them effectively and use those learnings to navigate towards unlocking continual growth.&rdquo;</span> <span class=\"c0 c6\"><a class=\"c5\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.coelevate.com/essays/growth-process-first-tactics-second&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1589454257761000\">Brian Balfour</a></span></p>","\t<p class=\"c17\"><span style=\"overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 602.00px; height: 226.67px;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/static/images/image4.png\" style=\"width: 602.00px; height: 226.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);\" title=\"\"></span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c1\">(Source:</span> <span class=\"c1 c6 c13\"><a class=\"c5\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.coelevate.com/essays/growth-process-first-tactics-second&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1589454257762000\">The First Step To Building A Growth Machine &mdash; Brian Balfour</a></span><span class=\"c3 c1\">)</span></p>","\t<h2 class=\"c8\" id=\"h.473mgh8h2w2d\"><span class=\"c3 c4\">The Trial</span></h2>","\t<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">The challenge now was the execution of the trial. TfL was a bit afraid how the tubers might react to this change so they&rsquo;ve decided to reduce the amount of people exposed to just one escalator. Also instead of forcing people they went with the approach of encouragement:</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c3 c0\">&ldquo;That meant teams of staff standing at the bottom of the escalators with loudhailers, asking commuters, as cheerfully as possible, if they would mind standing on both sides.&rdquo;</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">Even by being so cheerful their initial results had some really nasty customer feedback:</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c3 c0\">&ldquo;This is a charter for the lame and lazy!&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;I know how to use a bloody escalator!&rdquo; said another. The pilot was &ldquo;terrible&rdquo;, &ldquo;loopy,&rdquo; &ldquo;crap&rdquo;, &ldquo;ridiculous&rdquo;, and a &ldquo;very bad idea&rdquo;; in a one-hour session, 18 people called it &ldquo;stupid&rdquo;. A customer who was asked to stand still replied by giving the member of staff in question the finger. One man, determined to stride to the top come what may, pushed a child to one side. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you let us walk if we want to?&rdquo; asked another. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t Russia!&rdquo;</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">Changing conventions is not for the faint of heart! The negative feedback will come, and more often than not it will come even before you start to run the test directly from your peers. You&rsquo;ve got to be resilient.</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c9\"><span class=\"c1 c6\"><a class=\"c5\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.sensible.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1589454257763000\">Steve Krugs</a></span><span class=\"c1\">, user experience and usability expert and author of two (</span><span class=\"c1 c6\"><a class=\"c5\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1589454257763000\">here</a></span><span class=\"c1\">&nbsp;&amp;</span> <span class=\"c1 c6\"><a class=\"c5\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Surgery-Made-Easy-Do-It-Yourself/dp/0321657292/ref%3Dpd_sim_14_6?ie%3DUTF8%26dpID%3D51QyFDusQxL%26dpSrc%3Dsims%26preST%3D_AC_UL160_SR125%252C160_%26refRID%3D144H61B1QRA5KC97EXAA&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1589454257764000\">here</a></span><span class=\"c3 c1\">) of the best selling books on the subject, might disagree with me on going against conventions.

Instead he should clearly navigate your product following established conventions and visual cues. It is your product that needs to fit the user.</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">Though in his book Steve states something clearly:</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c0\">&ldquo;There may be some times when you choose to have your site do some of these &lsquo;user-unfriendly&rdquo; things deliberately. Sometimes it makes business sense to not to do exactly what the customer wants. For instance, uninvited pop-ups almost always annoy people to some extent. But if your statistics show you can get 10% more revenue by using it and you think it&rsquo;s worth annoying your customers you can do it. It&rsquo;s a business decision. Just be sure do it in an informed way, rather inadvertently&rdquo;</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">And that&rsquo;s precisely what TfL did and it payed off The escalator used to carry 12.745 customers in rush hour, now it with people standing on left and right carried 16.220 &mdash; a 27% improvement in capacity. The results exceeded even their initial theoretical hypothesis!</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">The trial was a success. Enough to start implementing in any escalator with enough steepness right? Nope&hellip;</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">After some time customers got used to standing on the left of the escalators which made TfL think it was time to unplug the &ldquo;encouragement&rdquo; treatment.</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">After only just one week people were back to their old habit again&hellip;</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">The next challenge was set: How could the TfL influence customer behaviour without direct input of it&rsquo;s workforce? But that I guess is for another article.</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">Even with this misshapen TfL is able to teach one final lesson about growth:</span></p>","\t<p class=\"c2\"><span class=\"c3 c1\">You never stop working on it!

is Culture equally important for Human Evolution and your Company?</h1>","<p>When I was in college I would more than often scoff at the notion of the idea of company culture.</p>","<p>All those missions, visions and values sounded a lot of kumbaya thinking. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I would think that they had their worth (on some organizations) but overall I always believed that these things were a reflection of a competitive advantage that a company had and that enabled them to care about culture. In short words, if the company was booming in profits it was ok to worry about these things; if not, what a waste of priorities.</p>","<p>And boy, was I wrong&hellip;<br />Culture &amp; Evolution<br />My Old Self: &ldquo;Wait what? What does Organizational Culture has to do with Evolution J&uacute;lio?&rdquo;<br />My New Self: &ldquo;It seems that culture is an impressive sort of technology we developed during our first periods as a species!&rdquo;<br />My Old Self: &ldquo;Oh boy&hellip;<br />My New Self: Bear with me!</p>","<p>Yuval Noah Harari, on his book <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens\">Sapiens</a>&nbsp;poses the question of why from all species in the world we were the ones to be able to succeed so rapidly? And you might think that 70.000/30.000 years is not so &ldquo;quick&rdquo; but looking back to the accumulated Earth&rsquo;s history and its species you could say that Sapiens were the most quickest &ldquo;startup&rdquo; to dominate the world.</p>","<p>But why? What was the reason for that success? As the author describes, neanderthals or the chimpanzees or other types of primates were far stronger than our big headed ancestors. Not to mention other predators that were bigger, quicker and deadlier than us.</p>","<p>As the author describes it, there was a revolution that changed the rules of the game: the cognitive revolution. This revolution enabled our species to communicate in a way that was never done before by any other. While other species were only capable of talking about things in the immediate or present we evolved to a stage where we could not only talk about the physical world in the past and future but as well complete imagined realities. Sapiens&nbsp;developed the ability to talk about things it never touched, smelled or seen. Such things as religions, myths, fantasies (or cultures) were and are an ability that we alone as species detain.</p>","<p>Why is this important? Well it turns out that this type of bio-tech is extremely important for cooperation in large numbers. Other animals can forge the bindings of cooperation but they are capped. Chimpanzees, for example, are able to form groups but no bigger than 50 and even humans using only personal relationships are capped around 150 (even with Facebook nowadays the ability is around 350). Why? Because you are capped in time to acquire, know and maintain your relationships, or in other words to develop and maintain the trust needed for cooperation.</p>","<p>Its through shared belief that you can get more people to cooperate. If we believe in the same thing I can trust you will act in the same accordance. If you and me (let&rsquo;s say in Medieval Europe) believe the pope has indeed spoke to God and called for a holy crusade we will join forces in the Holy Land. If we believe that the lines someone draw on a map and called it a country are real we can cooperate to defend our homeland. If you and me believe a piece of paper with people imprinted on them is worth something I&rsquo;m able to trade other things for it with you.</p>","<p>The idea is that if we trust on each other on the fundamental and imaginary blocks that we invent, we can build on top of it and develop our cooperation further on the real world.</p>","<p>From large hunting parties to large empires and finally to a global world it was the competitive advantage of Sapiens developing social constructs and communicating them that it got us here!</p>","<p>When you to come to think of it, and the author plays around this many times, it was our ability to think of imagined realities and constructs that enabled us to conquer the physical reality.</p>","<p>So I ask, what do you think a company culture is?</p>","<p>Just like the examples before, it&rsquo;s nothing more of a social construct and communication tool of its own. It&rsquo;s not a fundamental truth (if there is one&hellip;). It&rsquo;s a set of principles or direction that its shared (or should be) between the members of the organization in order to enable them to agree on specific fundamentals and give them the ability to make decisions on their own according to those fundamentals.</p>","<p>As a company grows, this construct/culture becomes harder to maintain. Especially because until a certain point you could count that people would just trust you and everything would be fine. Why not? They all knew you right? Though as the pace starts to accelerate and the number of people starts to grow this personal interaction becomes unsustainable. Much like the chimpanzees, you&rsquo;re capped.</p>","<p>In order to scale, you will need to build and rely on a shared belief, a critical mission, a set of values and principles that both you and your organization believe in. This is fundamental to build and maintain the necessary trust for cooperation. Failing to do so will consume most of your time in communication and hampering significantly your progress.</p>","<p>&ldquo;In every human interaction, the required amount of communication is inversely proportional to the level of trust&rdquo; &mdash; Ben Horowitz.</p>","<p>As I was trying to find more about culture I stumbled once again on the teachings of Ben Horowitz. He has an <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2017/03/04/culture-and-revolution-ben-horowitz-toussaint-louverture\">amazing talk</a>&nbsp;about culture that you should definitely listen to.</p>","<p>The objective of the talk is not so much as to define culture itself but otherwise to explain its importance and how to make the necessary changes if you want to revotionalize your company. Ben actually says at the beginning all the great CEO&rsquo;s that mentored him said that culture is really important but none of them could define it or explain it right.</p>","<p>He defines it as the underlying criteria for your important decisions in the company and that it manifests in the following ways:</p>","<ol start=\"1\">","<li>The Collective Behaviour of everyone in the organization</li>","<li>It&rsquo;s what people do when left to their own devices</li>","<li>It&rsquo;s the Organization&rsquo;s way of doing things</li>","</ol>","<p>It really gets down to one thing: it&rsquo;s what your people are doing when you are not looking. And guess what? That&rsquo;s 99% of the time. Seems a good investment to make in a company.</p>","<p>Don&rsquo;t be a Chimp or Neanderthal 🙈&mdash; invest on culture and just like our species you might end up conquering the world(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DsB_nEtZxPog\">s</a>).</p>","<p>The online <a href=\"https://html-cleaner.com/\" target=\"_blank\">HTML, CSS and JS beautifiers</a> will take care of your dirty web code.

If you have conviction on a particular direction even though there&rsquo;s no consensus, it&rsquo;s helpful to say, &ldquo;Look, I know we disagree on this but will you gamble with me on it? Disagree and commit?&rdquo; By the time you&rsquo;re at this point, no one can know the answer for sure, and you&rsquo;ll probably get a quick yes.</p>","\t\t\t<p>This isn&rsquo;t one way. If you&rsquo;re the boss, you should do this too. I disagree and commit all the time.&rdquo;</p>","\t\t\t<p>When I read this the first time I loved it. It cuts noise, its pragmatic and saves a lot of time to people and consequently to the company. It takes a sense of maturity and delegation capability to be able to do something like this but in the company of a <a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/amazon-the-company-with-a-100-ceos-cannot-be-stopped\">hundered CEO&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;it seems damn appropriate.</p>","\t\t\t<p>Since I&rsquo;ve read this I&rsquo;ve been preaching this &ldquo;mantra&rdquo; do different number of people both in my professional and personal settings. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that data/facts do not come first in decision making but, in the absence of it, this pragmatic approach can eliminate those frequent meetings that seem to consume your and your company's time like wildfire.</p>","\t\t\t<p>I&rsquo;ve seen clearly its limitations as well (right in my skin!), though. There are critical conditions to make this work, especially if you&rsquo;re in the commit and not in the agree end.</p>","\t\t\t<p>About one year ago I took a project that I was pretty vocal about. I really believe that it was one of those solutions that feels like a patch/bandage&nbsp;on&nbsp;a symptom instead of a real cure on the root of the illness. I don&rsquo;t believe in silver bullets and neither should you.

Instead, I took the advice of Jeff Bezos - Disagree and Commit.</p>","\t\t\t<p>The project was intense. Not only the initiative had a high risk, it was connected to almost every stakeholder/department in the company. More than running it operationally, I guess l, the main pain point of it involved significant conflict resolution between parties.</p>","\t\t\t<p>Data was not abundant to sort disagreements, so a lot of opinions started to get thrown around and once again we would get to those &ldquo;Disagree &amp; Commit&rdquo; cliffs or worse&hellip; deciding the victor by resilience: who would fight longer would get its way.</p>","\t\t\t<p>It&rsquo;s when you get to those obstacles that it starts to hit you: </p>","\t\t\t<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Why the hell did I committed to this&hellip; I did not even agree with this in the first place....&rdquo;;</p>","\t\t\t<p>The execution starts to falter.

The spiral of &ldquo;not gonna work&rdquo; starts to get you and you start to lose your energy and most importantly your will and resilience to push forward. </p>","\t\t\t<p>After this I don't have much advice.

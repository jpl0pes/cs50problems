            <h3>Hello World! It's me, Julio ðŸ‘‹ </h3>
            <p>
                I enjoy solving problems in an impactful and measurable way. Now and then I build or help build things.
                I worked at <a href="https://monzo.com/">Monzo</a> and <a href="https://uniplaces.com/">Uniplaces</a>
                leading multiple product teams. Now I'm on my own (for now ðŸ˜Š).

                This website is for fun purposes of discovering and testing new things.
